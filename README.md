# Introduction

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

# Features

* Full support for **MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase and SAP MaxDB** database management systems.
* Full support for six SQL injection techniques: **boolean-based blind, time-based blind, error-based, UNION query, stacked queries and out-of-band**.
* Support to **directly connect to the database** without passing via a SQL injection, by providing DBMS credentials, IP address, port and database name.
* Support to enumerate **database users, users' password hashes, users' privileges, users' roles, databases, tables and columns**.
* Automatic recognition of password hashes format and support to **crack them with a dictionary-based attack**.
* Support to **dump database tables** entirely, a range of entries or specific columns as per user's choice. The user can also choose to dump only a range of characters from each column's entry.
* Support to **search for specific database names, specific tables across all databases or specific columns across all databases' tables**. This is useful, for instance, to identify tables containing custom application credentials where relevant columns' names contain string like name and pass.
* Support to **download and upload any file** from the database server underlying file system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
* Support to **execute arbitrary commands and retrieve their standard output** on the database server underlying operating system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
* Support to **establish an out-of-band stateful TCP connection between the attacker machine and the database server** underlying operating system. This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a Meterpreter session or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per user's choice.
* Support for **database process' user privilege escalation** via Metasploit's Meterpreter `getsystem` command.
