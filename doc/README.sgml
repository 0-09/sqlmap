<sect>Introduction

<p>
sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of
database servers. It comes with a kick-ass detection engine, many niche
features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches
lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the
database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands
on the operating system via out-of-band connections.


<sect1>Requirements

<p>
sqlmap is developed in <htmlurl url="http://www.python.org" name="Python">,
a dynamic object-oriented interpreted programming language.
This makes the tool independent from the operating system. It only
requires the Python interpreter version equal or higher than <bf>2.6</bf>.
The interpreter is freely downloadable from its
<htmlurl url="http://python.org/download/" name="official site">.
To make it even easier, many GNU/Linux distributions come out of the box
with Python interpreter installed and other Unices and Mac OSX too provide
it packaged in their formats and ready to be installed.
Windows users can download and install the Python setup-ready installer
for x86, AMD64 and Itanium too.

sqlmap relies on the <htmlurl url="http://metasploit.com/framework/"
name="Metasploit Framework"> for some of its post-exploitation takeover
features. You need to grab a copy of it from the
<htmlurl url="http://metasploit.com/framework/download/" name="download">
page - the required version is <bf>3.5</bf> or higher.
For the ICMP tunneling out-of-band takeover technique, sqlmap requires
<htmlurl url="http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&amp;action=view&amp;type=tool&amp;name=Impacket"
name="Impacket"> library too.

If you are willing to connect directly to a database server (<tt>-d</tt> switch), without passing
via a web application, you need to install Python bindings for the database
management system that you are going to attack:

<itemize>
<item>Firebird: <htmlurl name="python-kinterbasdb" url="http://kinterbasdb.sourceforge.net/">.
<item>Microsoft Access: <htmlurl name="python-pyodbc" url="http://pyodbc.googlecode.com/">.
<item>Microsoft SQL Server: <htmlurl name="python-pymssql" url="http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/">.
<item>MySQL: <htmlurl name="python-mysqldb" url="http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/">.
<item>Oracle: <htmlurl name="python cx_Oracle" url="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">.
<item>PostgreSQL: <htmlurl name="python-psycopg2" url="http://initd.org/psycopg/">.
<item>SQLite: <htmlurl name="python-pysqlite2" url="http://pysqlite.googlecode.com/">.
<item>Sybase: <htmlurl name="python-pymssql" url="http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/">.
</itemize>

If you plan to attack a web application behind NTLM authentication or use
the sqlmap update functionality (<tt>-</tt><tt>-update</tt> switch) you need to
install respectively <htmlurl url="http://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/"
name="python-ntlm"> and <htmlurl url="http://pysvn.tigris.org/"
name="python-svn"> libraries.

Optionally, if you are running sqlmap on Windows, you may wish to install
<htmlurl url="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro" name="PyReadline">
library to be able to take advantage of the sqlmap TAB completion and
history support features in the SQL shell and OS shell.
Note that these functionalities are available natively by Python standard
<htmlurl url="http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html" name="readline">
library on other operating systems.

You can also choose to install <htmlurl url="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/"
name="Psyco"> library to eventually speed up the sqlmap algorithmic
operations.


<sect1>Scenario

<sect2>Detect and exploit a SQL injection
<p>
Let's say that you are auditing a web application and found a web page
that accepts dynamic user-provided values on <tt>GET</tt> or <tt>POST</tt>
parameters or HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> values or HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value.
You now want to test if these are affected by a SQL injection
vulnerability, and if so, exploit them to retrieve as much information as
possible out of the web application's back-end database management system
or even be able to access the underlying file system and operating system.

In a simple world, consider that the target url is:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1</tt></tscreen>

Assume that:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=1</tt></tscreen>

is the same page as the original one and:

<tscreen><tt>http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=2</tt></tscreen>

differs from the original one, it means that you are in front of a SQL
injection vulnerability in the <tt>id</tt> <tt>GET</tt> parameter of the
<tt>index.php</tt> web application page which means that potentially no
IDS/IPS, no web application firewall, no parameters' value sanitization is
performed on the server-side before sending the SQL statement to the
back-end database management system the web application relies on.

This is a quite common flaw in dynamic content web applications and it
does not depend upon the back-end database management system nor on the web
application programming language: it is a programmer code's security flaw.
The <htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org" name="Open Web Application Security Project">
rated on 2010 in their <htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project"
name="OWASP Top Ten"> survey this vulnerability as the <htmlurl
url="http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf" name="most
common"> and important web application vulnerability along with other
injection flaws.

Back to the scenario, probably the SQL <tt>SELECT</tt> statement into
<tt>get_int.php</tt> has a syntax similar to the following SQL query, in
pseudo PHP code:

<tscreen><tt>
$query = "SELECT &#91;column(s) name&#93; FROM &#91;table name&#93; WHERE id=" . $_REQUEST['id'];
</tt></tscreen>

As you can see, appending any other syntatically valid SQL condition after
a value for <tt>id</tt> such condition will take place when the web
application passes the query to the back-end database management system
that executes it, that is why the condition <tt>id=1 AND 1=1</tt> is valid
(<em>True</em>) and returns the same page as the original one, with the
same content. This is the case of a boolean-based blind SQL injection
vulnerability. However, sqlmap is able to detect any type of SQL injection
and adapt its work-flow accordingly. Read below for further details.

Moreover, in this simple and easy to inject scenario it would be also
possible to append, not just one or more valid SQL condition(s), but also
stacked SQL queries, for instance something like <tt>[...]&amp;id=1;
ANOTHER SQL QUERY#</tt> if the web application technology supports
<em>stacked queries</em>, also known as <em>multiple statements</em>.

Now that you found this SQL injection vulnerable parameter, you can
exploit it by manipulating the <tt>id</tt> parameter value in the HTTP
request.

There exist many <htmlurl url="http://delicious.com/inquis/sqlinjection" name="resources">
on the Net explaining in depth how to prevent, detect and exploit SQL
injection vulnerabilities in web application and it is recommended to read
them if you are not familiar with the issue before going ahead with sqlmap.

Passing the original address, <tt>http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1</tt>
to sqlmap, the tool will automatically:

<itemize>
<item>Identify the vulnerable parameter(s) (<tt>id</tt> in this example);
<item>Identify which SQL injection techniques can be used to exploit the
vulnerable parameter(s);
<item>Fingerprint the back-end database management system;
<item>Depending on the user's options, it will extensively fingerprint,
enumerate data or takeover the database server as a whole.
</itemize>

<sect2>Direct connection to the database management system
<p>
Up until sqlmap version <bf>0.8</bf>, the tool has been <em>yet another
SQL injection tool</em>, used by web application penetration testers/newbies/curious
teens/computer addicted/punks and so on. Things move on
and as they evolve, we do as well. Now it supports this new switch,
<tt>-d</tt>, that allows you to connect from your machine to the database
server's TCP port where the database management system daemon is listening
on and perform any operation you would do while using it to attack a
database via a SQL injection vulnerability.


<sect1>Techniques

<p>
sqlmap is able to detect and exploit five different SQL injection
<em>types</em>:

<itemize>
<item><bf>Boolean-based blind SQL injection</bf>, also known as <bf>inferential
SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in
the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a
<tt>SELECT</tt> sub-statement, or any other SQL statement whose the user
want to retrieve the output.
For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response
headers/body with the original request, the tool inference the output of
the injected statement character by character. Alternatively, the user
can provide a string or regular expression to match on True pages.
The bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap to perform this technique
is able to fetch each character of the output with a maximum of seven HTTP
requests. Where the output is not within the clear-text plain charset,
sqlmap will adapt the algorithm with bigger ranges to detect the output.
<item><bf>Time-based blind SQL injection</bf>, also known as <bf>full blind
SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in
the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a
query which put on hold the back-end DBMS to return for a certain number
of seconds.
For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response
time with the original request, the tool inference the output of
the injected statement character by character. Like for boolean-based
technique, the bisection algorithm is applied.
<item><bf>Error-based SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap replaces or append to the
affected parameter a database-specific syntatically wrong statement and
parses the HTTP response headers and body in search of DBMS error messages
containing the injected pre-defined chain of characters and the statement
output within. This technique works when the web application has been
configured to disclose back-end database management system error messages
only.
<item><bf>UNION query SQL injection</bf>, also known as <bf>inband SQL
injection</bf>: sqlmap appends to the affected parameter a syntatically
valid SQL statement string starting with a <tt>UNION ALL SELECT</tt>.
This techique works when the web application page passes the output of the
<tt>SELECT</tt> statement within a <tt>for</tt> cycle, or similar, so that
each line of the query output is printed on the page content.
sqlmap is also able to exploit <bf>partial (single entry) UNION query SQL
injection</bf> vulnerabilities which occur when the output of the
statement is not cycled in a <tt>for</tt> construct whereas only the first
entry of the query output is displayed.
<item><bf>Stacked queries SQL injection</bf>, also known as <bf>multiple
statements SQL injection</bf>: sqlmap tests if the web application supports
stacked queries then, in case it does support, it appends to the affected
parameter in the HTTP request, a semi-colon (<tt>;</tt>) followed by the
SQL statement to be executed. This technique is useful to run SQL
statements other than <tt>SELECT</tt> like, for instance, <em>data
definition</em> or <em>data manipulation</em> statements possibly leading
to file system read and write access and operating system command
execution depending on the underlying back-end database management system
and the session user privileges.
</itemize>

<bf>Firebird</bf>, <bf>Sybase</bf> and <bf>SAP MaxDB</bf> database
management systems.

<item>Full support for five SQL injection techniques: <bf>boolean-based
blind</bf>, <bf>time-based blind</bf>, <bf>error-based</bf>,
<bf>UNION query</bf> and <bf>stacked queries</bf>.

<item>Support to <bf>directly connect to the database</bf> without passing
via a SQL injection, by providing DBMS credentials, IP address, port and
database name.

<item>It is possible to provide a single target URL, get the list of
targets from <htmlurl url="http://portswigger.net/suite/" name="Burp proxy">
or <htmlurl url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project"
name="WebScarab proxy"> requests log files, get the whole HTTP request
from a text file or get the list of targets by providing sqlmap with a
Google dork which queries <htmlurl url="http://www.google.com"
name="Google"> search engine and parses its results page. You can also
define a regular-expression based scope that is used to identify which of
the parsed addresses to test.

<item>Tests provided <bf>GET</bf> parameters, <bf>POST</bf> parameters,
HTTP <bf>Cookie</bf> header values, HTTP <bf>User-Agent</bf> header value
and HTTP <bf>Referer</bf> header value to identify and exploit SQL
injection vulnerabilities. It is also possible to specify a comma-separated
list of specific parameter(s) to test.

<item>Option to specify the <bf>maximum number of concurrent HTTP(S)
requests (multi-threading)</bf> to speed up the blind SQL injection
techniques. Vice versa, it is also possible to specify the number of
seconds to hold between each HTTP(S) request. Others optimization switches
to speed up the exploitation are implemented too.

<item><bf>HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header</bf> string support, useful when the
web application requires authentication based upon cookies and you have
such data or in case you just want to test for and exploit SQL injection
on such header values. You can also specify to always URL-encode the
Cookie.

<item>Automatically handles <bf>HTTP <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header</bf> from
the application, re-establishing of the session if it expires. Test and
exploit on these values is supported too. Vice versa, you can also force
to ignore any <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header.

<item>HTTP protocol <bf>Basic, Digest, NTLM and Certificate
authentications</bf> support.

<item><bf>HTTP(S) proxy</bf> support to pass by the requests to the target
application that works also with HTTPS requests and with authenticated
proxy servers.

<item>Options to fake the <bf>HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header</bf> value and
the <bf>HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header</bf> value specified by user or
randomly selected from a textual file.

<item>Support to increase the <bf>verbosity level of output messages</bf>:
there exist <bf>seven levels</bf> of verbosity.

<item>Support to <bf>parse HTML forms</bf> from the target URL and forge
HTTP(S) requests against those pages to test the form parameters against
vulnerabilities.

<item><bf>Granularity and flexibility</bf> in terms of both user's
switches and features.

<item><bf>Estimated time of arrival</bf> support for each query, updated
in real time, to provide the user with an overview on how long it will
take to retrieve the queries' output.

<item>Automatically saves the session (queries and their output, even if
partially retrieved) on a textual file in real time while fetching the
data and <bf>resumes the injection</bf> by parsing the session file.

<item>Support to read options from a configuration INI file rather than
specify each time all of the switches on the command line. Support also to
generate a configuration file based on the command line switches provided.

<item>Support to <bf>replicate the back-end database tables structure and
entries</bf> on a local SQLite 3 database.

<item>Option to update sqlmap to the latest development version from the
subversion repository.

<item>Support to parse HTTP(S) responses and display any DBMS error
message to the user.

<item>Integration with other IT security open source projects,
<htmlurl url="http://metasploit.com/framework/" name="Metasploit"> and <htmlurl
url="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/" name="w3af">.
</itemize>


<sect1>Fingerprint and enumeration features

<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf>Extensive back-end database software version and underlying
operating system fingerprint</bf> based upon
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html" name="error messages">,
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html" name="banner parsing">,
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html" name="functions output comparison"> and
<htmlurl url="http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html" name="specific features">
such as MySQL comment injection. It is also possible to force the back-end
database management system name if you already know it.

<item>Basic web server software and web application technology
fingerprint.

<item>Support to retrieve the DBMS <bf>banner</bf>, <bf>session user</bf>
and <bf>current database</bf> information. The tool can also check if the
session user is a <bf>database administrator</bf> (DBA).

<item>Support to enumerate <bf>database users</bf>, <bf>users' password
hashes</bf>, <bf>users' privileges</bf>, <bf>users' roles</bf>,
<bf>databases</bf>, <bf>tables</bf> and <bf>columns</bf>.

<item>Automatic recognition of password hashes format and support to
<bf>crack them with a dictionary-based attack</bf>.

<item>Support to <bf>brute-force tables and columns name</bf>. This is
useful when the session user has no read access over the system table
containing schema information or when the database management system does
not store this information anywhere (e.g. MySQL < 5.0).

<item>Support to <bf>dump database tables</bf> entirely, a range of
entries or specific columns as per user's choice. The user can also choose
to dump only a range of characters from each column's entry.

<item>Support to automatically <bf>dump all databases</bf>' schemas and
entries. It is possibly to exclude from the dump the system databases.

<item>Support to <bf>search for specific database names, specific tables
across all databases or specific columns across all databases'
tables</bf>. This is useful, for instance, to identify tables containing
custom application credentials where relevant columns' names contain
string like <em>name</em> and <em>pass</em>.

<item>Support to <bf>run custom SQL statement(s)</bf> as in an interactive
SQL client connecting to the back-end database. sqlmap automatically
dissects the provided statement, determines which technique fits best to
inject it and how to pack the SQL payload accordingly.
</itemize>


<sect1>Takeover features

<p>
Some of these techniques are detailed in the white paper
<htmlurl url="http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857"
name="Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control"> and in the
slide deck <htmlurl url="http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/expanding-the-control-over-the-operating-system-from-the-database"
name="Expanding the control over the operating system from the database">.

<itemize>
<item>Support to <bf>inject custom user-defined functions</bf>: the user
can compile a shared library then use sqlmap to create within the back-end
DBMS user-defined functions out of the compiled shared library file. These
UDFs can then be executed, and optionally removed, via sqlmap. This is
supported when the database software is MySQL or PostgreSQL.

<item>Support to <bf>download and upload any file</bf> from the database
server underlying file system when the database software is MySQL,
PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.

<item>Support to <bf>execute arbitrary commands and retrieve their
standard output</bf> on the database server underlying operating system
when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
<itemize>
<item>On MySQL and PostgreSQL via user-defined function injection and
execution.
<item>On Microsoft SQL Server via <tt>xp_cmdshell()</tt> stored procedure.
Also, the stored procedure is re-enabled if disabled or created from
scratch if removed by the DBA.
</itemize>

<item>Support to <bf>establish an out-of-band stateful TCP connection
between the attacker machine and the database server</bf> underlying
operating system. This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a
Meterpreter session or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per
user's choice.
sqlmap relies on Metasploit to create the shellcode and implements four
different techniques to execute it on the database server. These
techniques are:
<itemize>
<item>Database <bf>in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode</bf>
via sqlmap own user-defined function <tt>sys_bineval()</tt>. Supported on
MySQL and PostgreSQL.
<item>Upload and execution of a Metasploit's <bf>stand-alone payload
stager</bf> via sqlmap own user-defined function <tt>sys_exec()</tt> on
MySQL and PostgreSQL or via <tt>xp_cmdshell()</tt> on Microsoft SQL
Server.
<item>Execution of Metasploit's shellcode by performing a <bf>SMB
reflection attack</bf> (<htmlurl
url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-068.mspx"
name="MS08-068">) with a UNC path request from the database server to
the attacker's machine where the Metasploit <tt>smb_relay</tt> server
exploit listens. Supported when running sqlmap with high privileges
(<tt>uid=0</tt>) on Linux/Unix and the target DBMS runs as Administrator
on Windows.
<item>Database in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode by
exploiting <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005
<tt>sp_replwritetovarbin</tt> stored procedure heap-based buffer
overflow</bf> (<htmlurl
url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx"
name="MS09-004">). sqlmap has its own exploit to trigger the
vulnerability with automatic DEP memory protection bypass, but it relies
on Metasploit to generate the shellcode to get executed upon successful
exploitation.
</itemize>

<item>Support for <bf>database process' user privilege escalation</bf> via
Metasploit's <tt>getsystem</tt> command which include, among others,
the <htmlurl
url="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-01/0346.html"
name="kitrap0d"> technique (<htmlurl
url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-015.mspx"
name="MS10-015">).

<item>Support to access (read/add/delete) Windows registry hives.
</itemize>

</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>Output verbosity

<p>
Switch: <tt>-v</tt>

<p>
This switch can be used to set the verbosity level of output messages.
There exist <bf>seven</bf> levels of verbosity.
The default level is <bf>1</bf> in which information, warning, error and
critical messages and Python tracebacks (if any occur) will be displayed.

<itemize>
<item><bf>0</bf>: Show only Python tracebacks, error and critical messages.
<item><bf>1</bf>: Show also information and warning messages.
<item><bf>2</bf>: Show also debug messages.
<item><bf>3</bf>: Show also payloads injected.
<item><bf>4</bf>: Show also HTTP requests.
<item><bf>5</bf>: Show also HTTP responses' headers.
<item><bf>6</bf>: Show also HTTP responses' page content.
</itemize>

<p>
A reasonable level of verbosity to further understand what sqlmap does
under the hood is level <bf>2</bf>, primarily for the detection phase and
the take-over functionalities. Whereas if you want to see the SQL payloads
the tools sends, level <bf>3</bf> is your best choice.
In order to further debug potential bugs or unexpected behaviours, we
recommend you to set the verbosity to level <bf>4</bf> or above. This
level is recommended to be used when you feed the developers with a bug
report too.


<sect1>Target

<p>
At least one of these options has to be provided.

<sect2>Target URL

<p>
Switch: <tt>-u</tt> or <tt>-</tt><tt>-url</tt>

<p>
Run sqlmap against a single target URL. This switch requires an argument
which is the target URL in the form <tt>http(s)://targeturl[:port]/[...]</tt>.

<sect2>Parse targets from Burp or WebScarab proxy logs

<p>
Switch: <tt>-l</tt>

<p>
Rather than providing a single target URL, it is possible to test and
inject against HTTP requests proxied through <htmlurl url="http://portswigger.net/suite/"
name="Burp proxy"> or <htmlurl
url="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project"
name="WebScarab proxy"> This switch requires an argument which is the
proxy's HTTP requests log file.

<sect2>Load HTTP request from a file

<p>
Switch: <tt>-r</tt>

<p>
One of the possibilities of sqlmap is loading of complete HTTP request
from a textual file. That way you can skip usage of bunch of other
options (e.g. setting of cookies, POSTed data, etc).

<p>
Sample content of a HTTP request file provided as argument to this switch:

<tscreen><verb>
POST /sqlmap/mysql/post_int.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.136.131
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0

id=1
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Process Google dork results as target addresses

<p>
Switch: <tt>-g</tt>

<p>
It is also possible to test and inject on <tt>GET</tt> parameters on the
results of your Google dork.

<p>
This option makes sqlmap negotiate with the search engine its session
cookie to be able to perform a search, then sqlmap will retrieve Google
first 100 results for the Google dork expression with <tt>GET</tt>
parameters asking you if you want to test and inject on each possible
affected URL.

<p>
Example of Google dorking with expression <tt>site:yourdomain.com
ext:php</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -g "site:yourdomain.com ext:php" -v 1

[hh:mm:38] [INFO] first request to Google to get the session cookie
[hh:mm:40] [INFO] sqlmap got 65 results for your Google dork expression, 59 of them are 
testable hosts
[hh:mm:41] [INFO] sqlmap got a total of 59 targets
[hh:mm:40] [INFO] url 1:
GET http://yourdomain.com/example1.php?foo=12, do you want to test this 
url? [y/N/q] n
[hh:mm:43] [INFO] url 2:
GET http://yourdomain.com/example2.php?bar=24, do you want to test this 
url? [y/N/q] n
[hh:mm:42] [INFO] url 3:
GET http://thirdlevel.yourdomain.com/news/example3.php?today=483, do you 
want to test this url? [y/N/q] y
[hh:mm:44] [INFO] testing url http://thirdlevel.yourdomain.com/news/example3.php?today=483
[...]
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>Load options from a configuration INI file

<p>
Switch: <tt>-c</tt>

<p>
It is possible to pass user's options from a configuration INI file, an
example is <tt>sqlmap.conf</tt>.

<p>
Note that if you also provide other options from command line, those are
evaluated when running sqlmap and overwrite those provided in the
configuration file.


<sect1>Request

<p>
These options can be used to specify how to connect to the target url.

<sect2>HTTP data

<p>
Option: <tt>-</tt><tt>-data</tt>

<p>
By default the HTTP method used to perform HTTP requests is <tt>GET</tt>,
but you can implicitly change it to <tt>POST</tt> by providing the data to
be sent in the <tt>POST</tt> requests. Such data, being those parameters,
are tested for SQL injection as well as any provided <tt>GET</tt>
parameters.


<sect2>HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-cookie</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-drop-set-cookie</tt>
and <tt>-</tt><tt>-cookie-urlencode</tt> 

<p>
This feature can be useful in two ways:

<itemize>
<item>The web application requires authentication based upon cookies and
you have such data.
<item>You want to detect and exploit SQL injection on such header values.
</itemize>

<p>
Either reason brings you to need to send cookies with sqlmap requests, the
steps to go through are the following:

<itemize>
<item>Login to the application with your favourite browser.
<item>Get the HTTP Cookie from the browser's preferences or from the HTTP
proxy screen and copy to the clipboard.
<item>Go back to your shell and run sqlmap by pasting your clipboard as
the argument of the <tt>-</tt><tt>-cookie</tt> switch.
</itemize>

<p>
Note that the HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header values are usually separated by
a <tt>;</tt> character, <bf>not</bf> by an <tt>&amp;</tt>. sqlmap can
recognize these as separate sets of <tt>parameter=value</tt> too, as well
as GET and POST parameters.

<p>
If at any time during the communication, the web application responds with
<tt>Set-Cookie</tt> headers, sqlmap will automatically use its value in
all further HTTP requests as the <tt>Cookie</tt> header. sqlmap will also
automatically test those values for SQL injection. This can be avoided by
providing the switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-drop-set-cookie</tt> - sqlmap will
ignore any coming <tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header.

<p>
Vice versa, if you provide a HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header with
<tt>-</tt><tt>-cookie</tt> switch and the target URL sends an HTTP
<tt>Set-Cookie</tt> header at any time, sqlmap will ask you which set of
cookies to use for the following HTTP requests.

<p>
sqlmap by default does <bf>not</bf> URL-encode generated cookie payloads,
but you can force it by using the <tt>-</tt><tt>-cookie-urlencode</tt>
switch. Cookie content encoding is not declared by HTTP protocol standard
in any way, so it is solely the matter of web application's behaviour.

<p>
Note that also the HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header is tested against SQL
injection if the <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt> is set to <bf>2</bf> or above.
Read below for details.


<sect2>HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-user-agent</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-random-agent</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap performs HTTP requests with the following <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value:

<tscreen><verb>
sqlmap/0.9 (http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net)
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
However, it is possible to fake it with the <tt>-</tt><tt>-user-agent</tt>
switch by providing custom User-Agent as the switch argument.

<p>
Moreover, by providing the <tt>-</tt><tt>-random-agent</tt> switch, sqlmap
will randomly select a <tt>User-Agent</tt> from the <tt>./txt/user-agents.txt</tt>
textual file and use it for all HTTP requests within the session.

<p>
Some sites perform a server-side check on the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt>
header value and fail the HTTP response if a valid <tt>User-Agent</tt> is
not provided, its value is not expected or is blacklisted by a web
application firewall or similar intrusion prevention system. In this case
sqlmap will show you a message as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
[hh:mm:20] [ERROR] the target url responded with an unknown HTTP status code, try to 
force the HTTP User-Agent header with option --user-agent or --random-agent
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Note that also the HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> header is tested against SQL
injection if the <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt> is set to <bf>3</bf> or above.
Read below for details.


<sect2>HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-referer</tt>

<p>
It is possible to fake the HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header value. By default
<bf>no</bf> HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header is sent in HTTP requests if not
explicitly set.

<p>
Note that also the HTTP <tt>Referer</tt> header is tested against SQL
injection if the <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt> is set to <bf>3</bf> or above.
Read below for details.


<sect2>Extra HTTP headers

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-headers</tt>

<p>
It is possible to provide extra HTTP headers by setting the
<tt>-</tt><tt>-headers</tt> switch. Each header must be separated by a
newline and it is much easier to provide them from the configuration INI
file. Have a look at the sample <tt>sqlmap.conf</tt> file for an example.


<sect2>HTTP protocol authentication

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-auth-type</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-auth-cred</tt>

<p>
These options can be used to specify which HTTP protocol authentication
the web server implements and the valid credentials to be used to perform
all HTTP requests to the target application.

The three supported HTTP protocol authentication mechanisms are:

<itemize>
<item><tt>Basic</tt>
<item><tt>Digest</tt>
<item><tt>NTLM</tt>
</itemize>

While the credentials' syntax is <tt>username:password</tt>.

<p>
Example of valid syntax:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/basic/get_int.php?id=1" \
  --auth-type Basic --auth-cred "testuser:testpass"
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>HTTP protocol certificate authentication

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-auth-cert</tt>

<p>
This switch should be used in cases when the web server requires proper
client-side certificate for authentication. Supplied values should be in
the form: <tt>key_file,cert_file</tt>, where <tt>key_file</tt> should be
the name of a PEM formatted file that contains your private key, while
<tt>cert_file</tt> should be the name for a PEM formatted certificate
chain file.


<sect2>HTTP(S) proxy

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-proxy</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-proxy-cred</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-ignore-proxy</tt>

<p>
It is possible to provide an HTTP(S) proxy address to pass by the HTTP(S)
requests to the target URL. The syntax of HTTP(S) proxy value is
<tt>http://url:port</tt>.

<p>
If the HTTP(S) proxy requires authentication, you can provide the
credentials in the format <tt>username:password</tt> to the
<tt>-</tt><tt>-proxy-cred</tt> switch.

<p>
If, for any reason, you need to stay anonymous, instead of passing by a
single predefined HTTP(S) proxy server, you can configure a <htmlurl
url="http://www.torproject.org/" name="Tor client"> together with
<htmlurl url="http://www.privoxy.org" name="Privoxy"> (or similar) on
your machine as explained on the Tor client guide and use the Privoxy
daemon, by default listening on <tt>127.0.0.1:8118</tt>, as the sqlmap
proxy.

<p>
The switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-ignore-proxy</tt> should be used when you want
to run sqlmap against a target part of a local area network by ignoring
the system-wide set HTTP(S) proxy server setting.


<sect2>Delay between each HTTP request

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-delay</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify a number of seconds to hold between each HTTP(S)
request. The valid value is a float, for instance <tt>0.5</tt> means half
a second.
By default, no delay is set.


<sect2>Seconds to wait before timeout connection

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-timeout</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify a number of seconds to wait before considering
the HTTP(S) request timed out. The valid value is a float, for instance
10.5 means ten seconds and a half.
By default <bf>30 seconds</bf> are set.


<sect2>Maximum number of retries when the HTTP connection timeouts

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-retries</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify the maximum number of retries when the HTTP(S)
connection timeouts. By default it retries up to <bf>three times</bf>.


<sect2>Filtering targets from provided proxy log using regular expression

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-scope</tt>

<p>
Rather than using all hosts parsed from provided logs with switch 
<tt>-l</tt>, you can specify valid Python regular expression to be used
for filtering desired ones.

Example usage:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -l burp.log --scope="(www)?\.target\.(com|net|org)"
</verb></tscreen>


<sect2>Avoid your session to be destroyed after too many unsuccessful requests

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-safe-url</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-safe-freq</tt>

<p>
Sometimes web applications or inspection technology in between destroys
the session if a certain number of unsuccessful requests is performed.
This might occur during the detection phase of sqlmap or when it exploits
any of the blind SQL injection types. Reason why is that the SQL payload
does not necessarily returns output and might therefore raise a signal to
either the application session management or the inspection technology.

<p>
To bypass this limitation set by the target, you can provide two switches:

<itemize>
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-safe-url</tt>: Url address to visit frequently during
testing.
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-safe-freq</tt>: Test requests between two visits to a
given safe url.
</itemize>

<p>
This way, sqlmap will visit every a predefined number of requests a
certain <em>safe</em> URL without performing any kind of injection against
it.


<sect1>Optimization

<p>
These switches can be used to optimize the performance of sqlmap.


<sect2>Bundle optimization

<p>
Switch: <tt>-o</tt>

<p>
This switch is an alias that implicitly sets the following switches:

<itemize>
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-keep-alive</tt>
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-null-connection</tt>
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-threads 4</tt>
<item><tt>-</tt><tt>-group-concat</tt>
</itemize>

<p>
Read below for details about each switch.


<sect2>Output prediction

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-predict-output</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>HTTP Keep-Alive

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-keep-alive</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>HTTP NULL connection

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-null-connection</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>Concurrent HTTP(S) requests

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-threads</tt>

<p>
It is possible to specify the maximum number of concurrent HTTP(S)
requests that sqlmap is allowed to do.
This feature relies on the <htmlurl url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading"
name="multi-threading"> concept and inherits both its pro and its cons.

<p>
This features applies to the brute-force switches and when the data
fetching is done through any of the blind SQL injection techniques.
For the latter case, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query
output in a single thread, then starts the multi-threading. Each thread is
assigned to retrieve one character of the query output. The thread ends
when that character is retrieved - it takes up to 7 HTTP(S) requests with
the bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap.

<p>
Note that the multi-threading switch does not affect any other SQL
injection technique. The maximum number of concurrent requests is set to
<bf>10</bf> for performance and site reliability reasons.


<sect2>MySQL GROUP_CONCAT() speed up

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-group-concat</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect1>Injection

<p>
These options can be used to specify which parameters to test for, provide
custom injection payloads and optional tampering scripts.


<sect2>Testable parameter(s)

<p>
Switch: <tt>-p</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap tests all <tt>GET</tt> parameters and <tt>POST</tt>
parameters. When the value of <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt> is >= <bf>2</bf>
it tests also HTTP <tt>Cookie</tt> header values. When this value is >=
<bf>3</bf> it tests also HTTP <tt>User-Agent</tt> and HTTP <tt>Referer</tt>
header value for SQL injections.
It is however possible to manually specify a comma-separated list of
parameter(s) that you want sqlmap to test. This will bypass the dependence
on the value of <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt> too.

<p>
For instance, to test for GET parameter <tt>id</tt> and for HTTP
<tt>User-Agent</tt> only, provide <tt>-p id,user-agent</tt>.


<sect2>Force the database management system name

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-dbms</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap automatically detects the web application's back-end
database management system.
As of version <bf>0.9</bf>, sqlmap fully supports the following database
management systems:

<itemize>
<item>MySQL
<item>Oracle
<item>PostgreSQL
<item>Microsoft SQL Server
<item>Microsoft Access
<item>SQLite
<item>Firebird
<item>Sybase
<item>SAP MaxDB
</itemize>

<p>
If for any reason sqlmap fails to detect the back-end DBMS once a SQL
injection has been identified or if you want to avoid an active fingeprint,
you can provide the name of the back-end DBMS yourself (e.g. <tt>postgresql</tt>).
For MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server provide them respectively in the form
<tt>MySQL &lt;version&gt;</tt> and <tt>Microsoft SQL Server &lt;version&gt;
</tt>, where <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> is a valid version for the DBMS; for
instance <tt>5.0</tt> for MySQL and <tt>2005</tt> for Microsoft SQL Server.

<p>
In case you provide <tt>-</tt><tt>-fingerprint</tt> together with
<tt>-</tt><tt>-dbms</tt>, sqlmap will only perform the extensive
fingerprint for the specified database management system only, read below
for further details.

<p>
Note that this option is <bf>not</bf> mandatory and it is strongly
recommended to use it <bf>only if you are absolutely sure</bf> about the
back-end database management system. If you do not know it, let sqlmap
automatically fingerprint it for you.


<sect2>Force the database management system operating system name

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-os</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap automatically detects the web application's back-end
database management system underlying operating system when this
information is a dependence of any other provided switch.
At the moment the fully supported operating systems are two:

<itemize>
<item>Linux
<item>Windows
</itemize>

<p>
It is possible to force the operating system name if you already know it
so that sqlmap will avoid doing it itself.

<p>
Note that this option is <bf>not</bf> mandatory and it is strongly
recommended to use it <bf>only if you are absolutely sure</bf> about the
back-end database management system underlying operating system. If you do
not know it, let sqlmap automatically identify it for you.


<sect2>Custom injection payload

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-prefix</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-suffix</tt>

<p>
In some circumstances the vulnerable parameter is exploitable only if the
user provides a specific suffix to be appended to the injection payload.
Another scenario where these options come handy presents itself when the
user already knows that query syntax and want to detect and exploit the
SQL injection by directly providing a injection payload prefix and suffix.

<p>
Example of vulnerable source code:

<tscreen><verb>
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('" . $_GET['id'] . "') LIMIT 0, 1";
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
To detect and exploit this SQL injection, you can either let sqlmap detect
the <bf>boundaries</bf> (as in combination of SQL payload prefix and
suffix) for you during the detection phase, or provide them on your own.
For example:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_str_brackets.php?id=1" \
  -p id --prefix "')" --suffix "AND ('abc'='abc"
[...]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
This will result in all sqlmap requests to end up in a query as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('1') <PAYLOAD> AND ('abc'='abc') LIMIT 0, 1";
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Which makes the query syntactically correct.

<p>
In this simple example, sqlmap could detect the SQL injection and exploit
it without need to provide custom boundaries, but sometimes in real world
application it is necessary to provide it when the injection point is
within nested <tt>JOIN</tt> queries for instance.


<sect2>Tamper injection data

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-tamper</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect1>Detection

<p>
These options can be used to specify how to parse and compare page content
from HTTP responses when using blind SQL injection technique.


<sect2>Level

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-level</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>Risk

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-risk</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>TODO: Page comparison

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-string</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-regexp</tt>

<p>
By default the distinction of a True query by a False one (basic concept
for Inferential blind SQL injection attacks) is done comparing injected
requests page content MD5 hash with the original not injected page content
MD5 hash.
Not always this concept works because sometimes the page content changes at
each refresh even not injecting anything, for instance when the page has a
counter, a dynamic advertisment banner or any other part of the HTML which
is render dynamically and might change in time not only consequently to
user's input.
To bypass this limit, sqlmap makes it possible to manually provide a
string which is <bf>always</bf> present on the not injected page
<bf>and</bf> on all True injected query pages, but that it is <bf>not</bf>
on the False ones. This can also be achieved by providing a regular
expression.
Such information is easy for an user to retrieve, simply try to inject on
the affected URL parameter an invalid value and compare original (not
injected) page content with the injected wrong page content to identify
which string or regular expression match is on not injected and True page
only.
This way the distinction will be based upon string presence or regular
expression match and not page MD5 hash comparison.

<p>
As you can see, the string after <tt>Dynamic content</tt> changes its
value every second. In the example it is just a call to PHP
<tt>time()</tt> function, but on the real world it is usually much more
than that.

<p>
Looking at the HTTP responses page content you can see that the first five
lines of code do not change at all.
So choosing for instance the word <tt>luther</tt> as an output that is
on the not injected page content and it is not on the False page content
(because the query condition returns no output so <tt>luther</tt> is not
displayed on the page content) and passing it to sqlmap, you are able to
inject anyway.

<p>
You can also specify a regular expression to match rather than a string if
you prefer.

<p>
As you can see, when one of these options is specified, sqlmap skips the
URL stability test.

<p>
<bf>Consider one of these options a MUST when dealing with a page
with content that changes itself at each refresh without modifying the
user's input</bf>.


<sect1>Techniques

<p>
These options can be used to tweak how specific SQL injection techniques
are tested.

<sect2>Seconds to delay the DBMS response for time-based blind SQL injection

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-time-sec</tt>

<p>
It is possible to set the seconds to delay the response when testing for
time-based blind SQL injection, by providing the
<tt>-</tt><tt>-time-sec</tt> option followed by an integer.
By default delay is set to <bf>5 seconds</bf>.

<sect2>TODO

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-union-cols</tt>

<p>
TODO

<sect2>TODO

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-union-char</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect1>Fingerprint

<sect2>TODO: Extensive database management system fingerprint

<p>
Switches: <tt>-f</tt> or <tt>-</tt><tt>-fingerprint</tt>

<p>
By default the web application's back-end database management system
fingerprint is performed requesting a database specific function which
returns a known static value. By comparing these value with the returned
value it is possible to identify if the back-end database is effectively
the one that sqlmap expected. Depending on the DBMS being tested, a
SQL dialect syntax which is syntatically correct depending upon the
back-end DBMS is also tested.

After identifying an injectable vector, sqlmap fingerprints the back-end
database management system and go ahead with the injection with its
specific syntax within the limits of the database architecture.

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap automatically fingerprints the web server operating
system and the web application technology by parsing some HTTP response headers.

<p>
If you want to perform an extensive database management system fingerprint
based on various techniques like specific SQL dialects and inband error
messages, you can  provide the <tt>-</tt><tt>-fingerprint</tt> option.

<p>
As you can see from the last example, sqlmap first tested for MySQL,
then for Oracle, then for PostgreSQL since the user did not forced the
back-end database management system name with option <tt>-</tt><tt>-dbms</tt>.

<p>
If you want an even more accurate result, based also on banner parsing,
you can also provide the <tt>-b</tt> or <tt>-</tt><tt>-banner</tt> option.

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap was also able to fingerprint the back-end DBMS
operating system by parsing the DBMS banner value.

<p>
As you can see, from the Microsoft SQL Server banner, sqlmap was able to
correctly identify the database management system patch level.
The Microsoft SQL Server XML versions file is the result of a sqlmap
parsing library that fetches data from Chip Andrews'
<htmlurl url="http://www.sqlsecurity.com/FAQs/SQLServerVersionDatabase/tabid/63/Default.aspx"
name="SQLSecurity.com site"> and outputs it to the XML versions file.


<sect1>Enumeration

<p>
These options can be used to enumerate the back-end database management
system information, structure and data contained in the tables. Moreover
you can run your own SQL statements.


<sect2>Banner

<p>
Switch: <tt>-b</tt> or <tt>-</tt><tt>-banner</tt>

<p>
Most of the modern database management systems have a function and/or 
an environment variable which returns the database management system
version and eventually details on its patch level, the underlying
system. Usually the function is <tt>version()</tt> and the environment
variable is <tt>@@version</tt>, but this vary depending on the target
DBMS.


<sect2>Session user

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-current-user</tt>

<p>
On the majority of modern DBMSes is possible to retrieve the database
management system's user which is effectively performing the query against
the back-end DBMS from the web application.


<sect2>Current database

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-current-db</tt>

<p>
It is possible to retrieve the database management system's database name
that the web application is connected to.


<sect2>Detect whether or not the session user is a database administrator

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-is-dba</tt>

<p>
It is possible to detect if the current database management system session
user is a database administrator, also known as DBA.
sqlmap will return <tt>True</tt> if it is, viceversa <tt>False</tt>.


<sect2>List database management system users

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-users</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the list of
users.


<sect2>List and crack database management system users password hashes

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-passwords</tt> and <tt>-U</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about the DBMS users' passwords, it is possible to enumerate
the password hashes for each database management system user.
sqlmap will first enumerate the users, then the different password hashes
for each of them.

<p>
Example against a PostgreSQL target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" --passwords -v 1

[...]
back-end DBMS: PostgreSQL
[hh:mm:38] [INFO] fetching database users password hashes
do you want to use dictionary attack on retrieved password hashes? [Y/n/q] y
[hh:mm:42] [INFO] using hash method: 'postgres_passwd'
what's the dictionary's location? [/tmp/sqlmap/txt/wordlist.txt] 
[hh:mm:46] [INFO] loading dictionary from: '/tmp/sqlmap/txt/wordlist.txt'
do you want to use common password suffixes? (slow!) [y/N] n
[hh:mm:48] [INFO] starting dictionary attack (postgres_passwd)
[hh:mm:49] [INFO] found: 'testpass' for user: 'testuser'
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] found: 'testpass' for user: 'postgres'
database management system users password hashes:
[*] postgres [1]:
    password hash: md5d7d880f96044b72d0bba108ace96d1e4
    clear-text password: testpass
[*] testuser [1]:
    password hash: md599e5ea7a6f7c3269995cba3927fd0093
    clear-text password: testpass
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Not only sqlmap enumerated the DBMS users and their passwords, but it also
recognized the hash format to be PostgreSQL, asked the user whether or not
to test the hashes against a dictionary file and identified the clear-text
password for the <tt>postgres</tt> user, which is usually a DBA along the
other user, <tt>testuser</tt>, password.

<p>
This feature has been implemented for all DBMS where it is possible to
enumerate users' password hashes, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL
Server pre and post 2005.

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-U</tt> option to specify the specific user
who you want to enumerate and eventually crack the password hash(es).
If you provide <tt>CU</tt> as username it will consider it as an alias for
current user and will retrieve the password hash(es) for this user.


<sect2>List database management system users privileges

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-privileges</tt> and <tt>-U</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the
privileges for each database management system user.
By the privileges, sqlmap will also show you which are database
administrators.

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-U</tt> option to specify the user who you
want to enumerate the privileges.

<p>
If you provide <tt>CU</tt> as username it will consider it as an alias for
current user and will enumerate the privileges for this user.


<sect2>List database management system users roles

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-roles</tt> and <tt>-U</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the
roles for each database management system user.

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-U</tt> option to specify the user who you
want to enumerate the privileges.

<p>
If you provide <tt>CU</tt> as username it will consider it as an alias for
current user and will enumerate the privileges for this user.

<p>
This feature is only available when the DBMS is Oracle.


<sect2>List database management system's databases

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-dbs</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about available databases, it is possible to enumerate the
list of databases.

<p>
Note that this feature is not available if the database management system
is Oracle.


<sect2>Enumerate database's tables

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-tables</tt> and <tt>-D</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about databases' tables, it is possible to enumerate
the list of tables for a specific database management system's databases.

<p>
If you do not provide a specific database with switch <tt>-D</tt>, sqlmap
will enumerate the tables for all DBMS databases.

<p>
Note that on Oracle you have to provide the <tt>TABLESPACE_NAME</tt>
instead of the database name.


<sect2>Enumerate database table columns

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-columns</tt>, <tt>-C</tt>, <tt>-T</tt> and <tt>-D</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to the system table containing
information about database's tables, it is possible to enumerate the list
of columns for a specific database table.
sqlmap also enumerates the data-type for each column.

<p>
This feature depends on the option <tt>-T</tt> to specify the table name
and optionally on <tt>-D</tt> to specify the database name. When the
database name is not specified, the current database name is used.
You can also provide the <tt>-C</tt> option to specify the table columns
name like the one you provided to be enumerated.

<p>
Example against a MySQL target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://debiandev/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --columns -D testdb \
  -T users -C name
[...]
Database: testdb
Table: users
[2 columns]
+---------+---------------+
| Column  | Type          |
+---------+---------------+
| name    | varchar(500)  |
| surname | varchar(1000) |
+---------+---------------+
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Note that on PostgreSQL you have to provide <tt>public</tt> or the
name of a system database. That's because it is not possible to enumerate 
other databases tables, only the tables under the schema that the web
application's user is connected to, which is always aliased by
<tt>public</tt>.


<sect2>Dump database table entries

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-dump</tt>, <tt>-C</tt>, <tt>-T</tt>, <tt>-D</tt>,
<tt>-</tt><tt>-start</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-stop</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-first</tt>
and <tt>-</tt><tt>-last</tt>

<p>
When the session user has read access to a specific database's table it is
possible to dump the table entries.

<p>
This functionality depends on switch <tt>-T</tt> to specify the table
name and optionally on switch <tt>-D</tt> to specify the database name.
If the table name is provided, but the database name is not, the current
database name is used.

<p>
Example against a Firebird target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://debiandev/sqlmap/firebird/get_int.php?id=1" --dump -T users
[...]
Database: Firebird_masterdb
Table: USERS
[4 entries]
+----+--------+------------+
| ID | NAME   | SURNAME    |
+----+--------+------------+
| 1  | luther | blisset    |
| 2  | fluffy | bunny      |
| 3  | wu     | ming       |
| 4  | NULL   | nameisnull |
+----+--------+------------+
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
You can also provide a comma-separated list of the specific columns to
dump with the <tt>-C</tt> switch.

<p>
sqlmap also generates for each table dumped the entries in a CSV format
textual file.
You can see the absolute path where sqlmap creates the file by providing a
verbosity level greater than or equal to <bf>1</bf>.

<p>
If you want to dump only a range of entries, then you can provide switches
<tt>-</tt><tt>-start</tt> and/or <tt>-</tt><tt>-stop</tt> to respectively
start to dump from a certain entry and stop the dump at a certain entry.
For instance, if you want to dump only the first entry, provide
<tt>-</tt><tt>-stop 1</tt> in your command line. Vice versa if, for
instance, you want to dump only the second and third entry, provide
<tt>-</tt><tt>-start 1</tt> <tt>-</tt><tt>-stop 3</tt>.

<p>
It is also possible to specify which single character or range of characters
to dump with switches <tt>-</tt><tt>-first</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-last</tt>.
For instance, if you want to dump columns' entries from the third to the
fifth character, provide <tt>-</tt><tt>-first 3</tt> <tt>-</tt><tt>-last
5</tt>.
This feature only applies to the blind SQL injection techniques because for
error-based and UNION query SQL injection techniques the number of requests
is exactly the same, regardless of the length of the column's entry output
to dump.

<p>
As you know by down, sqlmap is <bf>flexible</bf>. You can leave it to
automatically enumerate the whole database table or you can be very
precise in which characters to dump, from which columns and which range of
entries.


<sect2>Dump all databases tables entries

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-dump-all</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-exclude-sysdbs</tt>

<p>
It is possible to dump all databases tables entries at once that the
session user has read access on.

<p>
You can also provide the <tt>-</tt><tt>-exclude-sysdbs</tt> switch to
exclude all system databases. In that case sqlmap will only dump entries
of users' databases tables.

<p>
Note that on Microsoft SQL Server the <tt>master</tt> database is not
considered a system database because some database administrators use it
as a users' database.


<sect2>Search for columns, tables or databases

<sect2>Run custom SQL statement

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-sql-query</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-sql-shell</tt>

<p>
The SQL query and the SQL shell features allow to run arbitrary SQL
statements on the database management system.
sqlmap automatically dissects the provided statement, determines which
technique is appropriate to use to inject it and how to pack the SQL
payload accordingly.

<p>
If the query is a <tt>SELECT</tt> statement, sqlmap will retrieve its
output.
Otherwise it will execute the query through the stacked query SQL
injection technique if the web application supports multiple statements on
the back-end database management system.
Beware that some web application technologies do not support stacked
queries on specific database management systems. For instance, PHP does
not support stacked queries when the back-end DBMS is MySQL, but it does
support when the back-end DBMS is PostgreSQL.

<p>
Examples against a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 target:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
  "SELECT 'foo'" -v 1

  "SELECT 'foo', 'bar'" -v 2

[...]
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] fetching SQL SELECT query output: 'SELECT 'foo', 'bar''
[hh:mm:50] [INFO] the SQL query provided has more than a field. sqlmap will now unpack it into 
distinct queries to be able to retrieve the output even if we are going blind
[hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] query: SELECT ISNULL(CAST((CHAR(102)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(111)) AS VARCHAR(8000)), 
(CHAR(32)))

[hh:mm:50] [INFO] retrieved: bar
[hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] performed 27 queries in 0 seconds
SELECT 'foo', 'bar':    'foo, bar'
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap splits the provided query into two different
<tt>SELECT</tt> statements then retrieves the output for each separate
query.

<p>
If the provided query is a <tt>SELECT</tt> statement and contains a
<tt>FROM</tt> clause, sqlmap will ask you if such statement can return
multiple entries. In that case the tool knows how to unpack the query
correctly to count the number of possible entries and retrieve its output,
entry per entry.

<p>
The SQL shell option allows you to run your own SQL statement
interactively, like a SQL console connected to the database management
system.
This feature provides TAB completion and history support too.

<sect2>Inject custom user-defined functions (UDF)

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-udf-inject</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-shared-lib</tt>

<p>
You can inject your own user-defined functions (UDFs) by compiling a
MySQL or PostgreSQL shared library, DLL for Windows and shared object for
Linux/Unix, then provide sqlmap with the path where the shared library
is stored locally on your machine. sqlmap will then ask you some
questions, upload the shared library on the database server file system,
create the user-defined function(s) from it and, depending on your
options, execute them. When you are finished using the injected UDFs,
sqlmap can also remove them from the database for you.

<p>
These techniques are detailed in the white paper
<htmlurl url="http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857"

This feature is available only when the database management system is
MySQL or PostgreSQL.


<sect1>File system access

<sect2>Read a file from the database server's file system

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-file-read</tt>

<p>
It is possible to retrieve the content of files from the underlying file
system when the back-end database management system is either MySQL,
PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed
privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and architectural
weaknesses.
The file specified can be either a textual or a binary file. sqlmap will
handle it properly.

<sect2>Upload a file to the database server's file system

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-file-write</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-file-dest</tt>

<p>
It is possible to upload a local file to the database server's file system
when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL
or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed privileges to
abuse database specific functionalities and architectural weaknesses.
The file specified can be either a textual or a binary file. sqlmap will
handle it properly.

<sect1>Operating system takeover

<sect2>Run arbitrary operating system command

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-cmd</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-shell</tt>

<p>
It is possible to <bf>run arbitrary commands on the database server's
underlying operating system</bf> when the back-end database management
system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the
session user has the needed privileges to abuse database specific
functionalities and architectural weaknesses.

<p>
On MySQL and PostgreSQL, sqlmap uploads (via the file upload functionality
explained above) a shared library (binary file) containing two
user-defined functions, <tt>sys_exec()</tt> and <tt>sys_eval()</tt>, then
it creates these two functions on the database and calls one of them to
execute the specified command, depending on user's choice to display the
standard output or not.
On Microsoft SQL Server, sqlmap abuses the <tt>xp_cmdshell</tt> stored
procedure: if it is disabled (by default on Microsoft SQL Server >= 2005),
sqlmap re-enables it; if it does not exist, sqlmap creates it from
scratch.

<p>
When the user requests the standard output, sqlmap uses one of the
enumeration SQL injection techniques (blind, inband or error-based) to
retrieve it. Vice versa, if the standard output is not required, stacked
query SQL injection technique is used to execute the command.

<p>
These techniques are detailed in the white paper

<p>
It is also possible to simulate a real shell where you can type as many
arbitrary commands as you wish. The option is <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-shell</tt> and has
the same TAB completion and history functionalities that
<tt>-</tt><tt>-sql-shell</tt> has.

<p>
Where stacked queries has not been identified on the web application
(e.g. PHP or ASP with back-end database management system being MySQL) and
the DBMS is MySQL, it is still possible to abuse the <tt>SELECT</tt>
clause's <tt>INTO OUTFILE</tt> to create a web backdoor in a writable
folder within the web server document root and still get command
execution assuming the back-end DBMS and the web server are hosted on the
same server.
sqlmap supports this technique and allows the user to provide a
comma-separated list of possible document root sub-folders where try to
upload the web file stager and the subsequent web backdoor. Also, sqlmap
has its own tested web file stagers and backdoors for the following
languages:

<itemize>
<item>ASP
<item>ASP.NET
<item>JSP
<item>PHP

<p>
It is possible to establish an <bf>out-of-band stateful TCP connection
between the attacker machine and the database server</bf> underlying
operating system when the back-end database management system is either
MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the
needed privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and
architectural weaknesses.
This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a Meterpreter session
or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per user's choice.

<p>
sqlmap relies on Metasploit to create the shellcode and implements four
different techniques to execute it on the database server. These
techniques are:
<itemize>
<item>Database <bf>in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode</bf>
via sqlmap own user-defined function <tt>sys_bineval()</tt>. Supported on
MySQL and PostgreSQL - switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-pwn</tt>.
<item>Upload and execution of a Metasploit's <bf>stand-alone payload
stager</bf> via sqlmap own user-defined function <tt>sys_exec()</tt> on
MySQL and PostgreSQL or via <tt>xp_cmdshell()</tt> on Microsoft SQL
Server - switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-pwn</tt>.
<item>Execution of Metasploit's shellcode by performing a <bf>SMB
reflection attack</bf> (<htmlurl
url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-068.mspx"
name="MS08-068">) with a UNC path request from the database server to
the attacker's machine where the Metasploit <tt>smb_relay</tt> server
exploit listens. Supported when running sqlmap with high privileges
(<tt>uid=0</tt>) on Linux/Unix and the target DBMS runs as Administrator
on Windows - switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-smbrelay</tt>.
<item>Database in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode by
exploiting <bf>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005
<tt>sp_replwritetovarbin</tt> stored procedure heap-based buffer
overflow</bf> (<htmlurl
url="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx"
name="MS09-004">). sqlmap has its own exploit to trigger the
vulnerability with automatic DEP memory protection bypass, but it relies
on Metasploit to generate the shellcode to get executed upon successful
exploitation - switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-os-bof</tt>.

<sect1>Windows registry access

<p>
It is possible to access Windows registry when the back-end database
management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server,
and when the web application supports stacked queries. Also, session user
has to have the needed privileges to access it.

<sect2>Read a Windows registry key value

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-read</tt>

<p>
Using this option you can read registry key values.

<sect2>Write a Windows registry key value

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-add</tt>

<p>
Using this option you can write registry key values.

<sect2>Delete a Windows registry key

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-del</tt>

<p>
Using this option you can delete registry keys.

<sect2>Auxiliary registry switches

<p>
Switches: <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-key</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-value</tt>,
<tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-data</tt> and <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-type</tt>

<p>
These switches can be used to provide data needed for proper running of
options <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-read</tt>, <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-add</tt> and 
<tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-del</tt>. So, instead of providing registry key
information when asked, you can use them at command prompt as program
arguments.

<p>
With <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-key</tt> option you specify used Windows registry
key path, with <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-value</tt> value item name inside
provided key, with <tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-data</tt> value data, while with
<tt>-</tt><tt>-reg-type</tt> option you specify type of the value item.

<p>
A sample command line for adding a registry key hive follows:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u http://192.168.136.128/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.aspx?id=1 --reg-add \

<p>
Switch: <tt>-t</tt>

<p>
TODO


<sect2>Session file: save and resume data retrieved

<p>
Switch: <tt>-s</tt>

<p>
By default sqlmap logs all queries and their output into a textual file
called <em>session file</em>, regardless of the technique used to extract
the data.
This is useful if you stop the injection for any reason and rerun it
afterwards: sqlmap will parse the session file and resume enumerated data
from it, then carry on extracting data from the exact point where it left
before you stopped the tool.

<p>
The default session file is <tt>output/TARGET_URL/session</tt>, but you
can specify a different file path with <tt>-s</tt> switch.

<p>
The session file has the following structure:

<tscreen><verb>
[hh:mm:ss MM/DD/YY]
[Target URL][Injection point][Parameters][Query or information name][Query output or value]
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
A more user friendly textual file where all data retrieved is saved, is
the <em>log file</em>, <tt>output/TARGET_URL/log</tt>. This file can be
useful to see all information enumerated to the end.


<sect2>Flush session file
    
<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-flush-session</tt>

<p>
As you are already familiar with the concept of a session file from the
description above, it is good to know that you can flush the content of
that file using option <tt>-</tt><tt>-flush-session</tt>.
This way you can avoid the caching mechanisms implemented by default in
sqlmap. Other possible way is to manually remove the session file(s).


<sect2>Estimated time of arrival

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-eta</tt>

<p>
It is possible to calculate and show in real time the estimated time of
arrival to retrieve each query output. This is shown when the technique
used to retrieve the output is any of the blind SQL injection types.

<p>
Example against an Oracle target affected only by boolean-based blind SQL
injection:

<tscreen><verb>
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/oracle/get_int_bool.php?id=1" -b --eta

[...]
[hh:mm:01] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is Oracle

<p>
Then:

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
As you can see, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query output,
then estimates the time of arrival, shows the progress in percentage and
counts the number of retrieved output characters.


<sect2>Update sqlmap

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-update</tt>

<p>
Using this option you can update the tool to the latest development
version directly from the subversion repository. You obviously need
Internet access.

<p>
If, for any reason, this operation fails, run <tt>svn update</tt> from
your sqlmap working copy. It will perform the exact same operation of
switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-update</tt>.
If you are running sqlmap on Windows, you can use the TartoiseSVN client
by right-clicking in Windows Explorer into your sqlmap working copy and
clicking on <tt>Update</tt>.

<p>
This is strongly recommended <bf>before</bf> reporting any bug to the
<htmlurl name="mailing lists" url="http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net/#ml">.


<sect2>Save options in a configuration INI file

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-save</tt>

<p>
It is possible to save the command line options to a configuration INI
file.
The generated file can then be edited and passed to sqlmap with the
<tt>-c</tt> option as explained above.


<sect2>Act in non-interactive mode

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-batch</tt>

<p>
If you want sqlmap to run as a batch tool, without any user's interaction 
when sqlmap requires it, you can force that by using
<tt>-</tt><tt>-batch</tt> switch. This will leave sqlmap to go with a
default behaviour whenever user's input would be required.

<sect2>Cleanup the DBMS from sqlmap specific UDF(s) and table(s)

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-cleanup</tt>

<p>
It is recommended to clean up the back-end database management system from
sqlmap temporary table(s) and created user-defined function(s) when you
are done taking over the underlying operating system or file system.
Switch <tt>-</tt><tt>-cleanup</tt> will attempt to clean up the DBMS and
the file system wherever possible.

<sect2>Use Google dork results from specified page number

<p>
Switch: <tt>-</tt><tt>-gpage</tt>

<p>
Default sqlmap behavior with option <tt>-g</tt> is to do a Google
search and use the first 100 resulting URLs for further SQL injection
testing. However, in combination with this option you can specify with
this switch, <tt>-</tt><tt>-gpage</tt>, some page other than the first one
to retrieve target URLs from.
